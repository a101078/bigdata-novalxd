# OpenStack Nova KVM with Exclusive Machine Scheduling - ODS Barcelona 2016
#     This OpenStack Juju Bundle deploys a model that is tailored to deploy
#     to a specific set of machines via MAAS.
#
# This bundle is a PoC/demo, not highly available, and is specific to the
# particular set of hardware used in a demo.  Further customization and
# important architectural decisions should be taken into consideration
# in each use case.
#
# TODO: add the actual OpenStack with Nova KVM bundle that was used.
